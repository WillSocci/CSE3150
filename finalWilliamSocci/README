This is my final! All of the instrucitons have been followed.
My output matches the output in the instructions.
EXCEPT for my special implementation which instantly deletes the ptr 
as soon as everything is over using get().  So when cleanup() is run 
it's already cleanedup!

SO that being said there isn't this in the final line:
ControlTimedSharedPtr 0x641840d2ceb0 end: 150 ms

But rather this:
ControlTimedSharedPtr expired already

If however, it isn't fast enough then yes it will print like the pdf
