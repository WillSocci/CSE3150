Here is my lab8. I had trouble witht an issue where my wallets would show up incorrectly and would result in wrong transfer.
I attempted a few different ways but this way seemed to work well. In order to compile my main and then my tests please see below:

cd labs/lab8

g++ main.cpp NfToken.cpp ManageTokens.cpp ShaMessageDigestHash.cpp -o main -lssl -lcrypto
./main

g++ test.cpp NfToken.cpp ManageTokens.cpp ShaMessageDigestHash.cpp -o test -lssl -lcrypto
./test
