This is my This is my Lab7!  My first run through of this lab I set my files up how I normally do.
by having a linking .h file and a functions .cpp file and then 2 seperate main and test .cpp files.
However I kept running into the issue where it said I had duplicate functions and calling the same thing from different places.
This was due to the bigint.h file and the way the multiple files interacted with it.  So to fix it I created just a main and test.cpp file
They both contain the same things and same format except main has a main that prints and the test file tests. SO.....

cd labs/lab7

**********      to compile the printing:    ***********
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main


**********      to compile tests:           ***********
g++ unittesting.cpp -o tests
./tests
