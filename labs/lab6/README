This is my lab6 code for lab6,  I made it so you can call two functions getToken and getWord.  The code will read through the passage.txt (get-verdict reading)
then is will seperate each unique word and give it a token (#).  THen the functions read the token and can produce the word and vice versa.

How to compile and run my code for the printing version:

g++ -o token tokenizer.cpp main.cpp
./token


How to compile and run my code for the testing version:

g++ -o test tokenizer.cpp test.cpp
./test
