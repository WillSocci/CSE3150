This is my lab6 code for lab6,  I made it so you can call two functions getToken and getWord.  The code will read through the passage.txt (get-verdict reading)
then is will seperate each unique word and give it a token (#).  THen the functions read the token and can produce the word and vice versa.

I also implemented regex code that ciphers through the punctuation and produces just alphanumerical characters.
One of my tests shows that this works:
I put a comma on the very first word "I," this is not the original text but it will be useful for my needs.

How to compile and run my code for the printing version:

cd labs/lab6

g++ -o token tokenizer.cpp main.cpp
./token

How to compile and run my code for the testing version:

g++ -o test tokenizer.cpp test.cpp
./test
