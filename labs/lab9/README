THis is my lab9 code! I created all the fucntions stated in the instrucitons and then provided
A main file to print it accordingly and a test file to unit test the code.
The rest of the answers will be on the google doc!

cd labs/lab9

To compile and run my tests and printing do the following:

g++ test.cpp linkedlist.cpp -o test
./test

g++ main.cpp linkedlist.cpp -o main
./main
