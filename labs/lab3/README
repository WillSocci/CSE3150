This is my new lab3 based on the new instructions
If you are looking for the old instructions access the other folder lab3(originaltry)

In order to run my tests use this to compile and then
run my program:

g++ test.cpp -o tests
./tests

My tests are testing for everything:
insert, copy constructor, delete, prefix sums, and the pointer jumper
