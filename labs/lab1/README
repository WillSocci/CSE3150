For Lab1 you will need to have the doctest.h available and ready to be used in the same codespace.
As well as a C++ compiler downloaded.
You also have to direct the program to the exact file path in order for it to be in effect and the tests to run.
After doing that you should be ready to run the program!

        ***RUNNING PROGRAM IN TERMINAL***
    In the terminal below enter:
$   g++ -o test_lab1 lab1.cpp -std=c++17
$   ./test_lab1

You should then see in the terminal a bunch of errors from the unit testing, and that means everything is working
The errors are just the edge cases doing their job, I'm testing a ton of lists that should work and fail for each respective function.
Some of the lists I used were:

{}              testing for nothing which should return true for both
{0}             should return true for both
{-1}            should return true for non_positive, false for non_negative
{1}             should return true for non_positive, false for non_negative
{1, -1, 1, -1}  should return true for non_negative, false for non_positive
{0, -1, 1, -1}  should return true for non_positive, false for non_negative
etc...          then 5 more similar cases which try to trick the program... all of which did not trick the program!
