First off, I want to clarify why there are 2 seperate lab files
I originally (lab2_noUnitTesting.cpp) made a file without the thought of using unit tests to test my code
so in that file when run using compile:

g++ -o lab2 lab2_noUnitTesting.cpp

to run:

./lab2

It will print with types of information regarding the balanced arrays, and non-negative vs non-positive arrays, along with the proportion and ratio for non-neg and non-pos

THEN realizing that I didn't build it to incorportate the unit testing I adjusted it by seperating each for loop etc. into its own function and then use the unit testing against each function.  I used the week 1 lab for most of the seperate functions seeing it would be most efficient

To compile the second file:

g++ -o lab2Tests lab2.cpp

to run:

./lab2Tests

!!AGAIN TO REITERATE!!

One file runs and prints the information about the trials
One file runs and runs unit testing
