This is my lab5! I recorded a video of how the tests run and the output for both unit testing and printing!

In order to compile for unit testing:

$ g++ -o tests tests.cpp distance.cpp
$ ./tests

In order to compile for printing all the distances:

$ g++ -o distance distance.cpp main.cpp
$ ./distance
