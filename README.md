***** HOW TO RUN AND TEST MY PROGRAMS ***** First you need to download the C++ compiler Then you need to download my unit tests which will be in a doctest.h format To download this direct here... https://github.com/doctest After that's downloaded you will need to have it pathed for each file (I will have done that for you already)

*** RUNNING THE PROGRAM IN TERMINAL *** In the codespace terminal first $ cd path Change your directory to the program you want to run Then in the terminal enter: $ g++ -o test_name file.cpp -std=c++17 $ ./test_name

Voila! The program should be running and the unit testing should be testing! For further information for each file and lab there will be a README file with more detailed instructions!
